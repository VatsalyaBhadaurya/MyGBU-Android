# App-Wide Monitoring Fix 🔧

## Problem Fixed ✅
**Issue**: TelegramLogger was only working in FacultyDashboardActivity, not capturing logs from other activities like AttendanceActivity, AssignmentManagementActivity, etc.

## Root Cause 🎯
Other activities were using regular `android.util.Log` instead of our custom `LogWrapper` that automatically sends logs to Telegram.

## Solution Applied 🛠️

### 1. Updated Import Statements
**Before:**
```kotlin
import android.util.Log
```

**After:**
```kotlin
import com.vatty.mygbu.utils.LogWrapper as Log
```

### 2. Activities Updated
- ✅ **AttendanceActivity.kt** - Now sends logs to Telegram
- ✅ **AssignmentManagementActivity.kt** - Now sends logs to Telegram  
- ✅ **FacultyDashboardActivity.kt** - Already working

### 3. Test Cases Added
**AttendanceActivity** now automatically sends these to Telegram:
- ℹ️ Activity startup: "AttendanceActivity started - monitoring enabled across the app!"
- ⚠️ Missing topics warning: "User tried to submit attendance without entering topics covered"
- ⚠️ Low attendance warning: "Low attendance detected: 65% (26/40)"

**AssignmentManagementActivity** now sends:
- ℹ️ Activity startup: "AssignmentManagementActivity started - app-wide monitoring active!"

## How It Works Now 🚀

### Automatic Capture
All activities using `LogWrapper as Log` will automatically send:
- ❌ **Error logs** (Log.e) → Instant Telegram notification
- ⚠️ **Warning logs** (Log.w) → Automatic Telegram notification  
- ℹ️ **Info logs** (Log.i) → Sent if contains important keywords

### Test It Yourself 🧪

1. **Open AttendanceActivity** → You'll get startup notification
2. **Try to submit without topics** → Warning sent to Telegram
3. **Mark low attendance** → Low attendance alert sent
4. **Open AssignmentManagementActivity** → Startup notification sent

## Next Steps for Complete Coverage 📋

To enable monitoring in ALL activities, update these files:
```bash
# Update these activities (similar to what we did):
- MainActivity.kt
- CoursesActivity.kt  
- NotificationsActivity.kt
- MessagesActivity.kt
- ScheduleActivity.kt
- AnalyticsActivity.kt
# etc.
```

## Usage Pattern 📱

In any activity where you want automatic Telegram logging:

```kotlin
// Replace this import:
import android.util.Log

// With this import:
import com.vatty.mygbu.utils.LogWrapper as Log

// Then use Log normally:
Log.e(TAG, "This error will be sent to Telegram!")
Log.w(TAG, "This warning will be sent to Telegram!")
Log.i(TAG, "Important info will be sent to Telegram!")
```

## Result 🎉
Now you'll see logs from **multiple activities** in your Telegram chat, not just FacultyDashboardActivity!

The monitoring is now **truly app-wide** across all updated activities. 🌟
