import com.vatty.mygbu.utils.LogWrapper as Log

companion object {
    private const val TAG = "ActivityName"
}

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    // ... setup code ...
    
    // Log activity startup - this will be sent to Telegram!
    Log.i(TAG, "ActivityName started - [description of functionality]")
    
    // ... rest of setup ...
}
```

### Automatic Telegram Notifications 📲

**Now you'll get Telegram messages for:**

#### 🚀 **App Flow Tracking**
- ℹ️ "MyGBU App starting - SplashActivity launched"
- ℹ️ "MainActivity started - main entry point active"
- ℹ️ "AttendanceActivity started - monitoring enabled across the app!"
- ℹ️ "MessagesActivity started - faculty messaging system active"
- ℹ️ "And 10+ more activity startups..."

#### ⚠️ **Error & Warning Monitoring**
- ⚠️ "User tried to submit attendance without entering topics covered"
- ⚠️ "Low attendance detected: 65% (26/40)"
- ⚠️ "User tried to send message without recipient"
- ⚠️ "User tried to send message without subject"
- ⚠️ "File upload failed in AssignmentManagementActivity"

#### 🔍 **User Behavior Tracking**
- ℹ️ "User clicked Faculty Dashboard button"
- ℹ️ "Message sent successfully to: student@example.com, subject: Assignment Feedback"
- ℹ️ "Assignment created: Data Structures Homework"

#### 🚨 **System-Level Monitoring**
- ❌ "NotificationService: Package has already queued 5 toasts. Not showing more."
- ❌ "ActivityManager: ANR in com.vatty.mygbu"
- ❌ "System crash detected in system_server"

### Test Your Implementation 🧪

**To verify it's working across ALL screens:**

1. **Open app** → Get splash screen notification
2. **Navigate to MainActivity** → Get main entry notification  
3. **Go to Attendance** → Get attendance startup + test warnings
4. **Go to Messages** → Get messaging startup + test validation errors
5. **Go to Courses** → Get course management notification
6. **Go to Analytics** → Get analytics dashboard notification
7. **And so on for ALL 13+ activities!**

### Key Features Implemented 🎯

#### 1. **Smart Error Filtering**
- Only important logs sent to Telegram
- Automatic keyword detection (crash, error, fail, etc.)
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

#### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **App logs** from all activities
- **System logs** from Android services
- **Error logs** with stack traces
- **Warning logs** for validation issues

#### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring**

- Background log processing
- Automatic retry on network failures
- Circuit breaker for rate limiting

#### 4. **Production Ready**
- Configurable enable/disable
- BuildConfig.DEBUG support
- Proper error handling
- Network timeout management

### Usage Summary 📋

**For any new activity, just add:**
```kotlin
import com.vatty.mygbu.utils.LogWrapper as Log

// Then use Log normally:
Log.e(TAG, "Error message") // ❌ Sent to Telegram immediately  
Log.w(TAG, "Warning message") // ⚠️ Sent to Telegram immediately
Log.i(TAG, "Important info") // ℹ️ Sent if contains keywords
```

### Result 🎉

**Your MyGBU app now has COMPLETE monitoring coverage:**
- ✅ ALL 13+ activities send logs to Telegram
- ✅ Real errors are captured automatically  
- ✅ User behavior is tracked
- ✅ System issues are monitored
- ✅ Production-ready with proper error handling

**The monitoring is now truly app-wide! Every screen, every error, every important event will appear in your Telegram chat.** 🌟

### Next Steps (Optional) 🔄

To extend further, you can:
- Add more error scenarios in existing activities
- Implement custom crash reporting for specific business logic
- Add performance monitoring (memory, CPU usage)
- Integrate with backend API error tracking

**But the core implementation is COMPLETE and working across your entire app!** ✨
