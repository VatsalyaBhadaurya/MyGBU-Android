#### **Navigation Flow:**
```
MainActivity → Faculty Dashboard → 8 Feature Modules
├── Assignment Management (Grades Card)
├── Courses (Courses/Schedule Cards)
├── Attendance & Class Summary (Attendance Card)
├── Student Performance (Students Card)
├── Leave Requests (Reports Card)
├── Faculty Hub (Profile Card)
└── Announcements (Announcements Card)
```

### **📱 User Experience:**

✅ **Material Design** - Modern UI components throughout

## **🚀 Ready for Testing:**

The faculty module is now complete and ready for testing. You can:

1. **Launch the app** → Tap "Faculty Dashboard"
2. **Explore all 8 modules** → Each card opens a fully functional screen
3. **Test navigation** → Bottom navigation works across all screens
4. **Experience the flow** → Matches the proposed design exactly

## **📋 Next Steps:**

1. **Database Integration** - Connect to real data sources
2. **Authentication** - Add faculty login system
3. **API Integration** - Connect to university systems
4. **Student Module** - Implement student dashboard
5. **Real-time Features** - Add notifications and live updates
